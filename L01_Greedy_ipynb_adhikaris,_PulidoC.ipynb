        "**SUMMARY**: A brief summary description of the design and implementation, including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result you achieved and the amount of time you spent as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results. This should be no more than two paragraphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project, we implemented the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) solution using a greedy algorithm. The design was straightforward, focusing on building a route by visiting the nearest unvisited node at each step. Initially, I thought the design would be more complex, but it turned out to be simpler with a clear structure. We made sure to complete all functions, from extracting data to calculating distances and visualizing the graph. We spent about X hours coding, testing, and debugging this solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PERSONNEL**: A description of who you worked with and on what sections.  It is expected that all collaboration is done as pair programming together. Also, note these collaborations in the code section itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "I worked with Clau throughout the project in a pair programming approach. We took turns as the driver and navigator, with me driving for tasks like setting up coordinates and Clau driving for tasks like implementing the distance calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**CHALLENGES**: Descriptions of the largest challenges you overcame and what made them challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "The biggest challenge we faced was ensuring that the greedy algorithm produced a valid tour that returned to the starting point. It was tricky to figure out how to efficiently update the list of unvisited nodes while keeping track of the route.\n",
        "\n",
        "**INNOVATIONS**: Any innovations that were not specifically required by the assignment. These are not required, but should be highlighted if included.\n",
        "\n",
        "We didn't introduce major innovations beyond the assignment requirements, but we did optimize the way we handled the list of unvisited nodes to reduce unnecessary recalculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TESTING**: Describe how you tested this work.\n",
        "\n",
        "FIXME\n",

        "**ERRORS**: A list in bulleted form of all known errors and deficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "We tested the program by running it with different sets of data, including both small and medium-sized graphs. The graph visualization helped us confirm that the route was being correctly calculated.\n",
        "**COMMENTS**: A paragraph or so of your own comments on and reactions to the Lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm might not always find the optimal route due to the limitations of the greedy approach.\n",
        "There could be occasional inaccuracies in floating-point distance calculations."
